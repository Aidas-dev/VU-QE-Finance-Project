### Conditions:

- The instrument return and all other parameters (variance, Beta and so on) is measured from 2015-10-01 to 2025-10-01. 

- We have to examine the past and make the best choice of instruments that should have been bought in 2015-10-01 and held to 2025-10-01, the easiest way to attempt do this task (as I understand).

- We have to calculate the monthly returns of our instruments over the ten years, from this we then calculate the other parameters.

- We will have to present our portfolio in 2 or 3 minutes, we will compete with other teams and the rest of the class will decide which portfolio they would like to invest in. The team with the most votes wins 0.5 points to the final grade. Therefore the portfolio should seem reasonable, not incredibly risky.
